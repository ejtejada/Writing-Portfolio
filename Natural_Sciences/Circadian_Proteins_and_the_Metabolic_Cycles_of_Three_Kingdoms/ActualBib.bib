	abstract = {Life on earth is subject to daily and predictable fluctuations in light intensity, temperature, and humidity created by rotation of the earth. Circadian rhythms, generated by a circadian clock, control temporal programs of cellular physiology to facilitate adaptation to daily environmental changes. Circadian rhythms are nearly ubiquitous and are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Here we introduce the molecular mechanism of the circadian clock in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We review the current understanding of the cyanobacterial clock, emphasizing recent work that has generated a more comprehensive understanding of how the circadian oscillator becomes synchronized with the external environment and how information from the oscillator is transmitted to generate rhythms of biological activity. These results have changed how we think about the clock, shifting away from a linear model to one in which the clock is viewed as an interactive network of multifunctional components that are integrated into the context of the cell in order to pace and reset the oscillator. We conclude with a discussion of how this basic timekeeping mechanism differs in other cyanobacterial species and how information gleaned from work in cyanobacteria can be translated to understanding rhythmic phenomena in other prokaryotic systems.},

abstract = {The phenotypes of mice carrying clock gene mutations have been critical to understanding the mammalian clock function. However, behavior does not necessarily reflect cell-autonomous clock phenotypes, because of the hierarchical dominance of the central clock. We performed cell-based siRNA knockdown and cDNA overexpression and monitored rhythm using bioluminescent reporters of clock genes. We found that knockdown of DBP, D-box positive regulator, in our model led to a short-period phenotype, whereas overexpressing of DBP produced a long-period rhythm when compared to controls. Furthermore, knockdown and overexpressing of E4BP4, D-box negative regulator, led to an opposite effect of DBP. Our experiments demonstrated that D-box regulators play a crucial role in determining the period length of Per1 and Per2 promoter-driven circadian rhythms in Rat-1 fibroblasts.},

 abstract = {Time of day-dependent variations of immune system parameters are ubiquitous phenomena in immunology. The circadian clock has been attributed with coordinating these variations on multiple levels; however, their molecular basis is little understood. Here, we systematically investigated the link between the circadian clock and rhythmic immune functions. We show that spleen, lymph nodes, and peritoneal macrophages of mice contain intrinsic circadian clockworks that operate autonomously even ex vivo. These clocks regulate circadian rhythms in inflammatory innate immune functions: Isolated spleen cells stimulated with bacterial endotoxin at different circadian times display circadian rhythms in TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion. Interestingly, we found that these rhythms are not driven by systemic glucocorticoid variations nor are they due to the detected circadian fluctuation in the cellular constitution of the spleen. Rather, a local circadian clock operative in splenic macrophages likely governs these oscillations as indicated by endotoxin stimulation experiments in rhythmic primary cell cultures. On the molecular level, we show that >8\% of the macrophage transcriptome oscillates in a circadian fashion, including many important regulators for pathogen recognition and cytokine secretion. As such, understanding the cross-talk between the circadian clock and the immune system provides insights into the timing mechanism of physiological and pathophysiological immune functions.},

abstract = {Circadian clock is an internal time keeping system recurring 24 h daily rhythm in physiology and behavior of organisms. Circadian clock contains transcription and translation feedback loop involving CLOCK/NPAS2, BMAL1, Cry1/2, and Per1/2. In common, heterodimer of CLOCK/NPAS2 and BMAL1 binds to EBOX element in the promoter of Per and Cry genes in order to activate their transcription. CRY and PER making heterodimeric complexes enter the nucleus in order to inhibit their own BMAL1-CLOCK-activated transcription. The aim of this study was to investigate and quantify real-time binding affinities of clock proteins among each other on and off DNA modes using surface plasmon resonance. The pairwise interaction coefficients among clock proteins, as well as interaction of PER2, CRY2, and PER2 : CRY2 proteins with BMAL1 : CLOCK complex in the presence and absence of EBOX motif have been investigated via analysis of surface plasmon resonance data with pseudo first-order reaction kinetics approximation and via nonlinear regression curve fitting. The results indicated that CRY2 and PER2, BMAL1, and CLOCK proteins form complexes in vitro and that PER2, CRY2 and PER2 : CRY2 complex have similar affinities toward BMAL1 : CLOCK complex. CRY2 protein had the highest affinity toward EBOX complex, whereas PER2 and CRY2 : PER2 complexes displayed low affinity toward EBOX complex. The quantification of the interaction between clock proteins is critical to understand the operation mechanism of the biological clock and to address the behavioral and physiological disorders, and it will be useful for the design of new drugs toward clock-related diseases.

 abstract = {In plants, the circadian clock controls daily physiological cycles as well as daylength-dependent developmental processes such as photoperiodic flowering and seedling growth. Here, we report that FIONA1 (FIO1) is a genetic regulator of period length in the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clock. FIO1 was identified by screening for a mutation in daylength-dependent flowering. The mutation designated fio1-1 also affects daylength-dependent seedling growth. fio1-1 causes lengthening of the free-running circadian period of leaf movement and the transcription of various genes, including the central oscillators CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1, LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1, and LUX ARRHYTHMO. However, period lengthening is not dependent upon environmental light or temperature conditions, which suggests that FIO1 is not a simple input component of the circadian system. Interestingly, fio1-1 exerts a clear effect on the period length of circadian rhythm but has little effect on its amplitude and robustness. FIO1 encodes a novel nuclear protein that is highly conserved throughout the kingdoms. We propose that FIO1 regulates period length in the Arabidopsis circadian clock in a close association with the central oscillator and that the circadian period can be controlled separately from amplitude and robustness.},

abstract = {Cyanobacteria possess circadian clocks consisting of KaiABC proteins, and circadian rhythm must closely relate to the primary metabolism. A histidine kinase, SasA, interacts with KaiC to transduce circadian signals and widely regulates transcription in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, although the involvement of SasA in primary metabolism has not been demonstrated at metabolite levels. Here, we generated a strain overexpressing hik8 (HOX80), an orthologue of SasA in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. HOX80 grew slowly under light conditions and lost viability under continuous dark conditions. Transcript levels of genes related to sugar catabolism remained higher in HOX80 under dark conditions. Metabolomic analysis revealed that under light conditions, glycogen was undetectable in HOX80, and there were decreased levels of metabolites of sugar catabolism and increased levels of amino acids, compared with those in the wild-type strain. HOX80 exhibited aberrant degradation of SigE proteins after a light-to-dark transition and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Hik8 directly interacts with KaiC1. The results of this study demonstrate that overexpression of hik8 widely alters sugar and amino acid metabolism, revealing the involvement of Hik8 in primary metabolism under both light and dark conditions in this cyanobacterium.}

abstract = {The circadian oscillator of cyanobacteria is composed of only three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. Together,they generate an autonomous \~ 24-h biochemical rhythm of phosphorylation of KaiC. KaiA stimulates KaiCphosphorylation by binding to the so-called A-loops of KaiC, whereas KaiB sequesters KaiA in a KaiABCcomplex far away from the A-loops, thereby inducing KaiC dephosphorylation. The switch from KaiCphosphorylation to dephosphorylation is initiated by the formation of the KaiB–KaiC complex, whichoccurs upon phosphorylation of the S431 residues of KaiC. We show here that formation of the KaiB–KaiCcomplex is promoted by KaiA, suggesting cooperativity in the initiation of the dephosphorylation complex. Inthe KaiA–KaiB interaction, one monomeric subunit of KaiB likely binds to one face of a KaiA dimer, leaving theother face unoccupied. We also show that the A-loops of KaiC exist in a dynamic equilibrium betweenKaiA-accessible exposed and KaiA-inaccessible buried positions. Phosphorylation at the S431 residues ofKaiC shift the A-loops toward the buried position, thereby weakening the KaiA–KaiC interaction, which isexpected to be an additional mechanism promoting formation of the KaiABC complex. We also show that KaiBand the clock-output protein SasA compete for overlapping binding sites, which include the B-loops on the CIring of KaiC. KaiA strongly shifts the competition in KaiB's favor. Thus, in addition to stimulating KaiCphosphorylation, it is likely that KaiA plays roles in switching KaiC from phosphorylation to dephosphorylation,as well as regulating clock output.},
