 abstract = {In plants, the circadian clock controls daily physiological cycles as well as daylength-dependent developmental processes such as photoperiodic flowering and seedling growth. Here, we report that FIONA1 (FIO1) is a genetic regulator of period length in the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clock. FIO1 was identified by screening for a mutation in daylength-dependent flowering. The mutation designated fio1-1 also affects daylength-dependent seedling growth. fio1-1 causes lengthening of the free-running circadian period of leaf movement and the transcription of various genes, including the central oscillators CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1, LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1, and LUX ARRHYTHMO. However, period lengthening is not dependent upon environmental light or temperature conditions, which suggests that FIO1 is not a simple input component of the circadian system. Interestingly, fio1-1 exerts a clear effect on the period length of circadian rhythm but has little effect on its amplitude and robustness. FIO1 encodes a novel nuclear protein that is highly conserved throughout the kingdoms. We propose that FIO1 regulates period length in the Arabidopsis circadian clock in a close association with the central oscillator and that the circadian period can be controlled separately from amplitude and robustness.},
