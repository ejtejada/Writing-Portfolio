Many, aspiring new undergraduate students enter the field of academia with the dream of spring-boarding into the health and medical fields. These ambitious, motivated students want to become the modern world's healers; they want to touch people's lives and fulfill their dreams of becoming doctors. However, many of these students brutally discover that this life-long career choice is both arduous and self-destructive for all but the most dedicated of students. Indeed, the road to doctorhood may be littered with moral pitfalls and the dreams of the super-majority (60\%) that fail to make it (\cite{Olsen-2016} 74). Even so, all of the fault is not on the students, as the current literature shows that colleges and universities do not guide premedical students on the academic, social, and moral battles needed to win entry into medical school.

	%Gameplan: Struggles in Academia
		%They aren't prepared or challeneged
Freshman who want to purse health professions already come from high school with serious disadvantages. On average, they enter college with only a fractional idea of what career to pursue, but in the case of premedical students, without a good road map of what to learn and how to learn it. As stated by Arum, a sociology professor at NYU, {``}Although growing proportions of high school graduates are entering higher education, many are not prepared for college-level work and many others have no clear plan for the future... students proceed to higher education regardless of their academic performance" (\cite{Arum-2011} 9). Still, even for those who select premedical as their path and commit to it, the earliest hurdles are introductory chemistry and biochemistry courses. Both of these are difficult not just due to nature of the subjects, but also because they are often taught poorly. Cooper, the Chemistry department head of Michigan State, noted that although premedical students go through almost two and a half years of chemistry, the inter-relationships between the concepts between classes do not form. She argues that a plurality of these students go through the motions of classes via rote memorization, but come of their time without understanding the applications of chemistry. Instead of building the bonds between the atomic to the biochemical, {``}Students see each step in the process as separate, and are often tested on them separately so that they do not see their overall purpose or value.... students must have relevant prior knowledge, new material must be explicitly connected to that prior knowledge" (\cite{Cooper-2013} 821). While this trend of memorizing over synthesizing seems like it might be due to some desire to shortcut the learning routes on behalf of premeds, further literature shows, that, on the contrary, premeds are trying more than others to understand and grasp the ideas.


		%They want to learn, but aren't given the tools.
One study conducted on the motivations of pre-meds was by Horowitz, a former associate professor of chemistry at Brooklyn College. He performed a study via a series of random selections and interviews, selecting only from the 2009 class that had self-indicated as 'Premed.' In this, Horowitz found that  {``}Only a small number of students (4 of 31) indicated that grades were all that mattered to them" (\cite{Horowitz-2010} 227). To the contrary, further surveying found that many of them desired to master hard STEM courses, and saw that {``}[D]oing well in pre-med courses was not sufficient ... that the real reason for wanting to learn the premed course material was simply in order to do well on the Medical College Admission Test" (\cite{Horowitz-2010} 230). So even though the research shows a plurality of these students desire to intrinsically understand their course material, the structure and learning objects in place by school administration solidly prevent this. For example, Arum criticizes the over reliance on {`}fact' based multiple choice exams and notes how short-lived the learning for these exams can be. He calls for a return to emphasis on free response and open ended questions, and that {``}While [students] may be acquiring subject-specific knowledge ...  many students are not improving their skills in critical thinking, complex reasoning, or writing" (\cite{Arum-2011} 14). All of Arum's learning metrics, which universites currently fail to meet, are also the cornerstones of the Medical College Admission Test, or MCAT, the final challenge that colleges also leave their students to fight without guidance.

		%They aren't given tools needed to conquer the MCAT
The MCAT acts as the ultimate dividing line between the upperclassmen who were planning to apply to medical school  and the upperclassmen that do apply.
