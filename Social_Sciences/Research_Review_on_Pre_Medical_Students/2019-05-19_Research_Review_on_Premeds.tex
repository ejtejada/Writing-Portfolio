Many aspiring new undergraduate students enter the field of academia with the dream of spring-boarding into the health and medical fields. These ambitious, motivated students want to become the modern world's healers; they want to touch people's lives and fulfill their dreams of becoming doctors. However, many of these students brutally discover that this life-long career choice is both arduous and self-destructive for all but the most dedicated of students. Indeed, the road to doctorhood may be littered with moral pitfalls and the dreams of the super-majority that fail to make it, but the literature shows that colleges and universities should bear the brunt of their failures to their students on the academic, social, and moral battles needed to win entry into medical school.
