 abstract = {Anaya performed statistical analysis to see if there was any correlation between MCAT scores and success in Medical Schools. She found, even when controlling for socioeconomic backgrounds, race, and gender, that the perceived rigor of the incoming student's undergraduate school and MCAT scores were the most influential factors for predicting success in Medical School.},
 %abstract	= {This study examines the influence of several college factors and learning activities on student learning as measured by performance on a standardized test. The study uses a national sample of 495 students who completed the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) four years after entering college in the United States in 1989. Multiple regression analysis is used to examine the impact of between- and within-institution learning environments, and non-academic activities on student learning. The relative influence of between-institution characteristics is reported to be greater than that of within-institution factors. For example, the standardized coefficients for attending a university (public or private) are 0.15, and for the variables “physical science major” and “worked on a professor’s research project” they are 0.08 and 0.07 respectively. The institutional type of college attended as an undergraduate, university as compared with 4-yr colleges, as well as opportunities to interact with faculty outside the classroom are positively associated with student performance.},

 abstract = {Cooper argues that the new 2015 revisions to the MCAT call for a system wide overhaul of how introductory and organic chemistry are taught. Cooper argues against following the Medical College Admissions Test learning guidelines, stating that instead the MCAT encourages a broken, mishmashed view of chemistry. Cooper ends on the note that the current circula fails to instill pattern recognition of chemical structures and resultant behaviors, but that catering to the new MCAT's criteria will not fix this problem.},
 %abstract = {The upcoming revised Medical College Admissions Test, based on the recommendations in the HHMI–AAMC report, could be an opportunity to reflect on and revise our curricula, not only for those students who are aiming for a career in the health sciences, but for all students. Unfortunately, the proposed chemistry learning objectives do not seem to provide a coherent framework with which to work. Rather, these objectives are fragments, disconnected ideas, and facts that are clearly parts of existing traditional curricula. If we rely on this report to redesign our courses, it is unlikely that redesign would produce students who understand the core concepts of chemistry. An alternate approach is to use the research on teaching and learning in chemistry to provide us with the evidence and learning theories on which to base curricular redesigns. Learning materials that are designed with an understanding that meaningful learning builds upon and connects to students’ prior knowledge, and that difficult concepts are best developed in a well designed scaffolded framework or learning progression are far more likely to help students develop robust understanding of chemical concepts.},

 abstract = {Horowitz studied and surveyed several hundred Premedical students at an all male, Jewish college.

 %abstract = {This qualitative study investigated the achievement goal orientations of a group of all male pre-med students attending a small, urban undergraduate college. Semi-structured interviews examined under what circumstances students adopted extrinsic goals, mastery goals, or a mixture of the two. Findings indicated that while nearly all students possessed an underlying or baseline extrinsic goal orientation, a sizable number of students (32\%) were primarily mastery oriented and only a small percent (13\%) were primarily extrinsically oriented. A large number of students did not fit either category, with many best described as being mastery oriented within certain subject areas and extrinsically oriented within others. Furthermore, this study found that social comparison (performance) goals were rarely mentioned spontaneously by students. The study concluded that the goal orientations of many students could best be described as complicated and conflicted with students experiencing a strong tension between a desire to learn and a desire to get good grades.},

 %abstract = {Biomedical socialization and premed culture have been shown to promote reductionist and depersonalized approaches to understanding human difference, a serious problem in contemporary health care. In 2015, the Association for American Medical Colleges (AAMC) launched a new version of its Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) that included material from sociology, providing sociology departments an unprecedented opportunity to instruct premed students on contextualizing human difference and being sensitive to the diverse trajectories of people in the health care system. This article describes a large, public research institution's introductory sociology course for premeds and draws on the students' reflective writing to show how premeds valued the complexity, critical perspective, open-minded capacity, and conceptual approaches that sociology had to offer. In applying the sociological material to their experiences or impressions of the medical field, premed students felt that sociological instruction would help them become a more socially minded and critically engaged doctor.},
