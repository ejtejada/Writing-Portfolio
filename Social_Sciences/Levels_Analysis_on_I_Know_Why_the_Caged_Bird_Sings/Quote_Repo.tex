Literal:
Maya and Bailey are our two protagonists; they are young black children from LBC.

"Marguerite and Bailey Johnson Jr., from Long Beach, California, en route to Stamps, Arkansas, do Mrs. Annie Henderson" (Angelou 4).

Crique (Tone): Self-loathing: Angelou will remind the reader that young Maya does not love herself because she was told by society that whiteness was equivalent to beauty.

Quote:
"I knew that once I put it on I'd look like a movie star. (It was silk and that made up for the awful color.) I was going to look like one of the sweet little white girls who were everybody's dream of what was right with the world" (Angelou 2).
"Wouldn't they be surprised when one day I woke out of my black ugly dream, and my real hair, which was long and blond, would take the place of the kinky mass that Momma wouldn't let me straighten? My light-blue eyes were going to hypnotize them, after all the things they said" (Angelou 3).
