Tone: Self-loathing: Angelou will remind the reader that young Maya does not love herself because she was told by society that whiteness was equivalent to beauty.

Quote:
"I knew that once I put it on I'd look like a movie star. (It was silk and that made up for the awful color.) I was going to look like one of the sweet little white girls who were everybody's dream of what was right with the world" (Angelou 2).
