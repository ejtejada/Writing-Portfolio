 abstract = {Cooper argues that the new 2015 revisions to the MCAT call for a system wide overhaul of how introductory and organic chemistry are taught. Cooper argues against following the Medical College Admissions Test learning guidelines, stating that instead the MCAT encourages a broken, mishmashed view of chemistry. Cooper ends on the note that the current circula fails to instill pattern recognition of chemical structures and resultant behaviors, but that catering to the new MCAT's criteria will not fix this problem.},
 %abstract = {The upcoming revised Medical College Admissions Test, based on the recommendations in the HHMI–AAMC report, could be an opportunity to reflect on and revise our curricula, not only for those students who are aiming for a career in the health sciences, but for all students. Unfortunately, the proposed chemistry learning objectives do not seem to provide a coherent framework with which to work. Rather, these objectives are fragments, disconnected ideas, and facts that are clearly parts of existing traditional curricula. If we rely on this report to redesign our courses, it is unlikely that redesign would produce students who understand the core concepts of chemistry. An alternate approach is to use the research on teaching and learning in chemistry to provide us with the evidence and learning theories on which to base curricular redesigns. Learning materials that are designed with an understanding that meaningful learning builds upon and connects to students’ prior knowledge, and that difficult concepts are best developed in a well designed scaffolded framework or learning progression are far more likely to help students develop robust understanding of chemical concepts.},

 abstract = {Olsen argues for the continued importance of Sociology classes and the humanities component of the new, 2015 MCAT. Olsen argues that if doctors are trained with only science and reductionist biochemistry, they will be unable to introspect on their societal roles, or worse, be unable to treat their patients with human dignity.},
 %abstract = {Biomedical socialization and premed culture have been shown to promote reductionist and depersonalized approaches to understanding human difference, a serious problem in contemporary health care. In 2015, the Association for American Medical Colleges (AAMC) launched a new version of its Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) that included material from sociology, providing sociology departments an unprecedented opportunity to instruct premed students on contextualizing human difference and being sensitive to the diverse trajectories of people in the health care system. This article describes a large, public research institution's introductory sociology course for premeds and draws on the students' reflective writing to show how premeds valued the complexity, critical perspective, open-minded capacity, and conceptual approaches that sociology had to offer. In applying the sociological material to their experiences or impressions of the medical field, premed students felt that sociological instruction would help them become a more socially minded and critically engaged doctor.},
