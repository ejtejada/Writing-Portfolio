The journey to deciding on and selecting premedical students as my subjects was suprisingly straightforward. I wanted to get to know more about one of my STEM cousins, and biology and all of its decendants were the most distant and interesting to me. I narrowed that down even further to dentists and doctors as two groups that I know I carry some negative sterotypes of. Then, I went to a club fair in early February, grabbed as many club flyers as I could, and emailed requests to observe to as all of the predentistry and premedical clubs on campus. Suprisingly there were almost ten such active organizations on campus, but almost a quarter of them were fraternties, and thus dead ends.
