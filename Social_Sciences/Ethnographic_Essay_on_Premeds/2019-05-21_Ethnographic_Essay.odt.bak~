<p style="Normal" xid="9" props="margin-top:0in; line-height:2.000000; margin-bottom:0in; font-size:12pt">	A few months ago I was tasked with selecting an on campus ethnographic group that was both accessible, but challenging to study. I keyed in on pre-health organizations I saw at a club fair event ; I chose them as alien-enough subjects such that I wanted to observe them in wild. Once I was <c props="lang:en-US; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; font-family:TeX Gyre Termes; color:#000000">(reluctantly) </c>welcomed by the local American Medical Student Association (AMSA) chapter, <c props="lang:en-US; font-size:12pt; font-weight:normal; font-family:TeX Gyre Termes; color:#000000">I began note taking and observing </c>them at their weekly club meetings for about a month. I entered with just a fanciful curiosity, but I instead left my field sites deeply concerned for the academic and social well being of these innocent students. I quickly learned that a hulking, stalking beast was ready to pounce on them, the yearly medical school application cycle. The clarity of the high rate of failure grew as I both accumulated outside research for my literature review and acquired meme knowledge from /r/premed, which some of the AMSA members recommenced. Thus, the resultant questions burned into my mind: what drives them down this path, what stops them, and does the UC help them?</p>
<p style="Normal" xid="10" props="margin-top:0in; line-height:2.000000; margin-bottom:0in; font-size:12pt"><c props="font-weight:bold">Outsider Observations:</c></p>
<p style="Normal" xid="11" props="text-align:left; font-size:12pt; margin-top:0in; line-height:2.000000; margin-bottom:0in; dom-dir:ltr">	My first day at AMSA was a cold night in February, as the vice president had emailed me the wrong room number in the Social Science Building. It was, thankfully, an empty and warm lecture hall where I foolishly waited and for an update from the VP. After 15 minutes where I was considering that perhaps I wasn’t really welcome, I received an update that the room had to had been changed on Facebook and their website, but after I had asked to join. Just the email requests to visit, but not join were showcases of how insular premedical students are, as their clubs have serious barrier to entry (interviews and membership fees). I noted that “[T]he room is same open room that AIAA meets, a big room with red desks, a projector, and a front stage. I never have classes here, so to me this is a club meeting room. These meeting are late, from 6:30 to 8 PM. I keep mind of my time, since I have to leave early to make it to class” (Tejada <c props="font-style:italic">Tales </c>1). Since it was clear I was never going to be treated like an insider by AMSA, I opted to do my field notes much like a naturalist does, via primarily observation with only minimal interaction.</p>
<p style="Normal" xid="49" props="text-align:left; font-size:12pt; margin-top:0in; line-height:2.000000; margin-bottom:0in; dom-dir:ltr">	The general structure of the meetings were that the first 30 minutes were lead by the President, a tall, large male student with a jovial expression and an apparent passion for medicine and keeping AMSA relevant. He presents slides on the current weeks agenda, and then gives the floor to either other executive board members to run exercises like mock interviews or elevator pitches, or he gives the floor to planned guest speakers. Suprisingly, the latter situation was common, as several pas</p>
<p style="Normal" xid="12" props="text-align:left; font-size:12pt; margin-top:0in; line-height:2.000000; margin-bottom:0in; dom-dir:ltr">	The first field day did end on a more interesting note however, as four students went up and gave a presentation on their experience working with CHFI to provide patient care in Argentina. CHFI is a ‘doctors without border’ type of organization that allows premedical students to get hands on patient care experience. The four presenters were composed of two prim and proper males, both dawning black dress shirts and ties, one business casual female in blue, and one business casual female in gray. They pitched their experience as both positive for the communities they helped and positive for their chances into medical school. On of the presenters pitched her experience, stating “[Her] day started at 7AM to catch the bus to her infections diseases hospital. Much like a ward, quarantine was enforced on some people. A spinal tap</p>
<p style="Normal" xid="41" props="text-align:left; line-height:2.000000; margin-top:0in; font-size:12pt; margin-bottom:0in; dom-dir:ltr">was done on one of the patients” <c props="font-family:TeX Gyre Termes; font-size:12pt; color:000000; text-decoration:none; text-position:normal; font-weight:normal; font-style:normal; lang:en-US">(Tejada </c><c props="font-family:TeX Gyre Termes; font-size:12pt; color:000000; text-decoration:none; text-position:normal; font-weight:normal; font-style:italic; lang:en-US">Tales 7</c><c props="font-family:TeX Gyre Termes; font-size:12pt; color:000000; text-decoration:none; text-position:normal; font-weight:normal; font-style:normal; lang:en-US">). Here, I had a moment where my stereotypes against premeds flared up. I asked my self, in my emotional response to this professional and wonderful presentation, are these premedical students really doing this to help poor Argentinians, or this really all about putting money into a study abroad program that can help their application get ahead? This first day left a concerning, lasting impression, because the presenters still framed all of their positive actions as how it helped themselves, first and foremost.</c></p>
<p style="Normal" xid="45" props="text-align:left; font-size:12pt; margin-top:0in; line-height:2.000000; margin-bottom:0in; dom-dir:ltr"><c props="font-family:TeX Gyre Termes; font-size:12pt; color:000000; text-decoration:none; text-position:normal; font-weight:normal; font-style:normal; lang:en-US">	With the question of altruism at the core premed students looming over my head, the next biggest event I observed was their late February, early March series of guest speakers. The first speaker was a graduating senior who discussed her trials and tribulation on her successful path to med school. She inspired me to learn more about this feral application process, but her presentation alarmed me on two fronts. First, it made me aware of the high cost and high rate of failure for each application cycle. Secondly, the guest speaker introduced me to Olsen’s research on the current trends in the application pool, that in 2014 </c><c>“[T]here were 47,815 applications to medical schools, and only 20,343 student matriculated. The average GPA for a matriculated student was 3.69” (Olsen 74). The guest speaker made great use of Olsen’s statistical data in her selection of potential schools, but this also motivated our speaker to improve her odds by spending over $8000 to applying to over 10 schools (even this action only increased her odds of getting into a single school to about a fair coin flip). I actually did break character and asked how a poor, on financial aid student could afford so many application. The speakers worried, but honest response was working part time in the summer to save for application, or loans.</c></p>
<p style="Normal" xid="47" props="text-align:left; font-size:12pt; margin-top:0in; line-height:2.000000; margin-bottom:0in; dom-dir:ltr"><c>	Following that horrifying, but educational, presentation, I continued shadowing the AMSA meetings to get a better feel for the group dynamics. There were mostly two cliques, those on the executive board, and general members. This was a common dynamic I had seen in other clubs, but this hierarchy was far more pronounced here than anywhere else I had seen. There was also notable gossip among the executive board regarding a certain upper division biology class having recycled an exact older midterm. This was an interesting debate to see between the President, who is a tall, large, but jolly man, and his predominately female executive board. The president </c></p>
